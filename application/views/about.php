	<h2> Frequently Asked Questions </h2>
	
	<p> <b> What is HTHS Secret Santa? </b> </br>
	HTHS Secret Santa is a web app built by and for HTHS students. By using technology to simplify the 
	<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Do-a-Secret-Santa"> Secret Santa</a> 
	process, we are able to ensure that the activity runs smoothly. :)</p>

	<p> <b> What if I want to have a Secret Santa among my own friends? </b> </br>
	We implemented a unique "groups" feature that allows you to participate in multiple Secret Santas.
	After you login/register, you are given to option to create your own group that is matched with a
	generated code. Share this code with your friends. If all of you input the same code, you'll be in the
	same Secret Santa group. </p>
	
	<p> <b> What is the price range for gifts? </b> </br>
	$10-$20. Be thoughtful! Don't get anything too big, or awkwardness ensues. </p>
