            <dt> What is HTHS Secret Santa?</dt>
            <dd>Currently in its second year of operations, <i>HTHS Secret Santa</i> is a web app built by and for HTHS
                students.
                Our goal is to foster community and giving in the High Tech community by organizing an intuitive
                <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Do-a-Secret-Santa"> Secret Santa</a>
                through a web application. We'd love for you to participate in this year's festivities!
            </dd>

            <dt> How do I register?</dt>
            <dd>You can register <a href="<?= base_url('login') ?>">here</a>. Be sure to use your "ctemc.org"
                email when registering!
            </dd>

            <dt> What if I want to have a Secret Santa among my own friends?</dt>
            <dd><i>You can!</i> We implemented a unique "groups" feature that allows you to participate in multiple <i>
                    Secret Santas </i>.
                After you login/register, you are given to option to create your own group that has a specifically
                generated code. Once you share this code with your friends, you'll be able to be matched with your
                friends in that
                same group. It's as simple as that!
            </dd>

            <dt> What is the price range for gifts?</dt>
            <dd>For the school-wide HTHS group, try to keep your budgets around $10. Remember that creative and
                thoughtful gifts
                are more valuable than excessively pricey gifts!
            </dd>

            <dt> What kinds of gifts should I buy?</dt>
            <dd>You can buy anything that you think that your exchange partner would enjoy! Please make sure it's school
                appropriate,
                because you will be bringing your gifts into school.
            </dd>

            <dt>What do I do if I don't want to participate anymore?</dt>
            <dd>You can remove yourself from any group as long as you do so before <i> Friday, 12/14 (when registration
                    ends). </i> Otherwise, don't back out of your commitments, or there will be repercussions. Don't be
                <i> that </i> guy.
