            <dt> What is HTHS Secret Santa?</dt>
            <dd>HTHS Secret Santa is a web app built by and for HTHS students. By using technology to simplify the
                <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Do-a-Secret-Santa"> Secret Santa</a>
                process, we are able to ensure that the activity runs smoothly. :)

            <dt> How do I register?</dt>
            <dd>You can register <a href="/login">here</a>. Be sure to use your "ctemc.org"
                email when registering!
            </dd>

            <dt> What if I want to have a Secret Santa among my own friends?</dt>
            <dd>We implemented a unique "groups" feature that allows you to participate in multiple Secret Santas.
                After you login/register, you are given to option to create your own group that is matched with a
                generated code. Share this code with your friends. If all of you input the same code, you'll be in the
                same Secret Santa group.
            </dd>

            <dt> What is the price range for gifts?</dt>
            <dd>For the school-wide HTHS group, the limit is $5. Be creative! For any private group, the recommended
                limit is
                $5-$15. Be thoughtful! Don't get anything too expensive or it will be awkward.
            </dd>

            <dt> What kinds of gifts should I buy?</dt>
            <dd>You can buy anything that you think that your exchange partner would enjoy! Just make sure that it's
                appropriate to bring into school. Don't be dumb.
            </dd>

            <dt> What if I get myself?</dt>
            <dd>You won't. Believe in Matt Hsu.</dd>

            <dt>What do I do if I don't want to participate anymore?</dt>
            <dd>You can remove yourself from any group as long as you do so before <i> Friday, 12/14 (when registration
                    ends). </i> Otherwise, don't back out of your commitments, or there will be repercussions. Don't be
                that
                guy.
